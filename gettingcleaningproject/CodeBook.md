Original variables were kept as is. Their names remain the same, but they were filtered, only the relevant variables were kept, i.e. the ones that show an average or standard deviation for the measurements.

The only new variables are the following:

1. `movement`: This is the variable that was previously just the y label, it is now part of the data set and describes the actual movement instead of only having a number represent it.
2. `subject`: This was also kept separately from the rest of the data, it is now included and is simply a number that represents the subject who was studied.
